	 * <pre><strong>Example:</strong></pre>
	 * Suppose you need to check if a <code>String</code> called 
	 * <code>expression</code> can be transformed into a double safely. 
	 * Here is a code snippet on how you could do it:
	 * 
	 * <pre>
	 * <code>
	 * double value;
	 * if (Utilities.isDoubleValue(expression)) {
	 *     value = Double.parseDouble(expression);

	 * } else {
	 *     // do whatever error treatment you need to in this situation.
	 * }

	 * @param expression the <code>String</code> which may contain, or not, a <code>double</code> value
	 * @return true if <code>expression</code> returns a <code>double</code>, or <code>false</code>, otherwise.
